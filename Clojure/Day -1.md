**Clojure** - Nice progress so far! Clojure is a functional programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), meaning it can leverage existing Java libraries while keeping its own elegant syntax.
It’s part of the LISP family, so you’ll notice lots of parentheses and a focus on expressions rather than statements.

One of its core ideas is immutability—once you create a value, it never changes, which helps with safer concurrency and predictable code. This mindset shifts how you design programs compared to mutable languages.

**For Example**:
Imagine you have a shared shopping list in an app. In Clojure, instead of editing the same list directly, you create a new version each time someone adds an item, ensuring no one’s changes overwrite another’s.

**immutable** - unchanged over time or unable to to change. **why** - "Think of Google Docs version history—each edit creates a new snapshot, so you can revisit any point without losing past changes."

**.** - for the consoles like as in js for clojure - (println "hello world") - output = hello worle nil (returns nil after output, which is normal in Clojure. That’s because its purpose is side effects, not data transformation.)

why **nil after output** - Since there’s nothing useful to return, it gives you nil, which in Clojure means “no value” or “nothing here.”

That nil is just the REPL showing you the function’s return value—your actual printed text already appeared above it. So the nil isn’t part of your message; it’s the function’s result.

For Example:
It’s like telling a joke to a friend—they laugh (side effect), but when you ask, ‘What’s the result?’ they shrug and say, ‘Nothing.’

**Clojure Data Types** = integers, booleans, strings
**Lists** : how to create - (list 1 2 3) or '(1 2 3) - output - (1 2 3)
**function** : (my-name "robert") - my-name - function name, "robert" - argument; - output - {:user-name "robert"}
**function**:  function calling - (set-prompt :color "red")
(reverse  "a-long-string") - it reverse the whole thing and it will give me.
**vectors** - ["1" "2" "3"]
**global variables** - we can use "def" and how to create (def a "bhanu") a = variable , value = "bhanu"
**local variables** - we can use "let" (let [a 1 b 2] (* a b)) - output - 2
**Maps as Dictionaries** - {:country "Australia"}
**Clojure In Build Functions** - reverse, first, second etc from list, 
**Range** - (range 100) 
**function** - (map (fn [n] (+ n (* n 10))) (range 1 10))
**lists** - (1 2 3)
**vectors(array)** - [1 2 3]
**sets

**EXAMPLES**
(def my-list '(1 2 3)) - def is a variable , my-list is the variable value name , '(1 2 3) - value
(def new-list (conj my-list 4)) - same as above the new-list is the variable name and "conj" - build in function which adds a element in thr front of the collection - output: (4 1 2 3)

In detailed:

Line 1:
(def my-list '(1 2 3))

def: defines a new var (variable) in the current namespace.
my-list: the name of the var you’re creating.
'(1 2 3): a quoted list containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The quote ' tells Clojure not to evaluate it, just treat it as literal data.
Line 2:
(def new-list (conj my-list 4))

def: again, defining a new var.
new-list: the name for the new collection.
(conj my-list 4): calls the conj function, which adds an element to a collection.
my-list: the original list (1 2 3).
4: the element to add.
For lists, conj adds to the front, so the result is (4 1 2 3).
Execution flow:

Clojure reads the expression.
It evaluates my-list to get (1 2 3).
conj creates a new list with 4 at the front.
def binds that new list to new-list.


**Basics: REPL, syntax, expressions**

Got it—let’s lock in the basics so you’re solid before we layer on complexity ✅.

REPL: Your interactive workspace—type code, see instant results, perfect for testing ideas.
Syntax: Clojure uses prefix notation—function first, then arguments, all wrapped in parentheses.
Expressions: Everything is an expression that returns a value, even control structures like if.

Key Highlight
REPL: interactive coding environment
Prefix notation syntax
Everything returns a value
Parentheses wrap function calls
Great for quick testing

 --> (if (> 5 3) "yes" "no) - "yes"
 --> (+ (do (println "Calculating...") 2) 3) - Calculating... 5

 **Data structures: lists, vectors, maps, sets** :
Lists: ordered, linked structure
Vectors: ordered, fast lookup
Maps: key-value storage
Sets: unique values only


**Lists** - '(1 2 3) - (1 2 3)
            (list 1 2 3) - (1 2 3)

    **cons** - (def my-list (cons 0 my-list)) ; => (0 1 2 3)
    **conj** - (Def newer-list (conj my-list 4)) ; => (4 1 2 4)

    Diff. b/t cons and conj :
        we can use the cons for the lists to add any number in front of the list. it works only for the lists.
        But conj will work for all the things like lists, vectors and it also adds in front of the list or vector and depends on the type of using.
        if you are using the lists you can use the cons.
        if you are working with lists, vectors etc you can use the conj.
        but for the vectors the values are added at the end.


**Vectors** - [1 2 3]
            we use the conj to add the values at the end of the vectors.
            (def (conj [1 2 3] 4)) - [1 2 3 4]

    **assoc** - Sure—assoc is your go-to for “updating” immutable collections like maps and vectors .

    For maps, (assoc {:a 1 :b 2} :c 3) returns a new map with :c added—original stays unchanged.

    For vectors, (assoc [10 20 30] 1 99) returns [10 99 30], replacing the value at index 1 with 99.

    It’s important to remember that assoc doesn’t mutate; it creates a fresh collection with your change applied. This keeps your old data safe for reference or undo operations.

    examples: (conj [1 2 3] 4) -> [1 2 3 4]
                (def my-vector [1 2 3])
                (def new-vectore (conj my-vector 6)) -> [1 2 3 6]

**Maps** like objects - {:a 1 :b 2}

    examples: 
        (conj {:a 1 :b 2} [:c 3]) -> {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3}
        (def my-map {:a 3 :b 4})
        (def new-map (conj my-map [:c 7])) -> {:a 3 :b 4 :c 7}

        (def my-expense {:category "food" :amount 200 :date "12/12/2034})
        (def updated-expense (assoc my-expense :amount 300))

        **dissoc** - removes the key from the map.
            (def my-expense {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} :b) -> {:a 1 :c 3}

**Sets** - it will stores and gives you only the unique values - ${1 2 3}
examples: 
    (conj #{1 2 3} 2) -> #{1 3 2}

    Let’s do it—set operations are perfect for managing categories in your tracker 🛠️.

    Union combines all unique elements from two sets:

    Code Example
    1(clojure.set/union #{:food :travel} #{:travel :entertainment})
    2; => #{:food :travel :entertainment}

    Intersection finds elements common to both:

    Code Example
    1(clojure.set/intersection #{:food :travel} #{:travel :entertainment})
    2; => #{:travel}

    There’s also difference, which removes items in the second set from the first—great for excluding certain categories.

**Functions** - defn and def is global variable both are different.
    (defn add-expense [amount category]
        {:amount amount :category category})

**Reduce** - (reduce + [100 200 300]) -> 600
    Here, + is applied between elements: (+ 100 200) → 300, then (+ 300 300) → 600.

    You can use reduce for totals, products, or even building new collections—perfect for summing expenses or calculating statistics in your tracker.

**Functions: defn, higher-order, let** : 
   . defn is how you define a function in Clojure—name, parameters, body.
   . Higher-order functions either take other functions as arguments or return them, enabling flexible patterns like passing custom filters or sorters.
   . let creates temporary bindings (variables) inside a function or block, making complex expressions easier to read.

    **higher order functions** :
        example : 
            (defn total-with-tax [amount tax-rate]
        (let [tax (* amount tax-rate)]
        (+ amount tax)))   


        calculate (num1 num2 operator)
            if(= operator "+")
                (+ num1 num2)
            elif(= operator "-")
                (- num1 num2)
            elif(= operator "*")
                (* num1 num2)
            elif(= operator "/")
                (/ num1 num2)
            else 
                (println "no operator matches")

               (defn calculator [num1 num2 op]
                (cond 
                    (= op "+") (+ num1 num2)
                    (= op "-") (- num1 num2)
                    (= op "*") (* num1 num2)
                    (and (= op "/") (not= num2 0)) (/ num1 num2) 
                    (= op "/") (println "Error: division by zero") 
                    :else (println "no operator matches")))
