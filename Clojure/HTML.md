Yes, htmx builds on HTML, so a solid foundation in core HTML is important. Here’s a focused learning path of HTML concepts and related web fundamentals to master before diving into htmx:

- HTML basics
  - Elements, tags, and attributes
  - The HTML document structure: `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
  - Semantic elements: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`
  - Common text content tags: headings `<h1>`–`<h6>`, paragraphs `<p>`, lists `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, spans and divs
  - Hyperlinks: `<a href="...">`
  - Images: `<img src="..." alt="...">`
  - Tables: `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`
  - Forms basics: `<form>`, inputs (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<button>`), labels `<label>`, `name`, `id`, `value`, `required`

- HTML attributes and accessibility
  - Global attributes (id, class, style, hidden, title, data-*)
  - ARIA basics for accessibility (roles, aria-labels, aria-live)
  - Form accessibility: associated `<label>` with `for` and `id`, fieldset/legend

- HTML forms and data submission
  - How forms submit data (GET vs POST)
  - Input types (text, email, number, date, checkbox, radio, file, etc.)
  - Default browser validation and custom validation hooks

- HTML5 features
  - Embedded content: `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<source>`, `<track>`
  - Multimedia attributes (controls, autoplay, muted, loop)
  - Local storage basics (brief intro, though JS is needed for full use)
  - Microdata and semantic tags for richer meaning (optional)

- HTML structure for dynamic updates
  - Understanding the DOM structure that you’ll manipulate or target with hx- attributes
  - ID and class conventions for selecting elements

- Script and style integration (to use with htmx effectively)
  - How to include CSS (inline, in `<style>`, or external CSS)
  - How to include JavaScript (external scripts, `<script>` tag)
  - The role of `data-` attributes in HTML for custom behavior (without needing JS)

- Basic client-side development mindset
  - Understanding how HTML, CSS, and JS interact in a browser
  - The concept of progressive enhancement: building with HTML first, then adding behavior

Optional but helpful precursors
- Understanding the browser rendering model at a high level (DOM, render tree)
- A tiny bit of JavaScript familiarity (events, DOM manipulation) to appreciate how htmx abstracts AJAX and content swapping

Quick next steps
- Build a few small static pages using semantic HTML to reinforce structure.
- Create a simple form page that submits to a mock endpoint (no htmx yet) to see standard behavior.
- Read a concise intro to htmx to see how it leverages HTML attributes for AJAX, swap, and server interactions after you’re comfortable with HTML basics.

If you’d like, I can tailor a learning plan with a timeline and practical mini-projects based on your current familiarity and goals.


**LEARN**

Great choice. Below is a Google Docs–friendly version of the printable Option A checklist. It uses simple headings, bullet lists, and checkboxes that render cleanly when printed or shared as a Google Doc. You can copy-paste this directly into a new Google Docs document.

Title: HTML Revision Checklist for htmx (1-day plan)

**Document structure**
 Include <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>
 Meta: charset UTF-8
 Meta: viewport for responsive design

**Semantic HTML basics**
 Use semantic elements: header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer
 Prefer semantic elements over excessive divs

**Text content and semantics**
 Headings: h1–h6
 Paragraphs and block-level text
 Lists: ul, ol, li
 Distinguish block vs inline elements

**Hyperlinks and media**
 Anchor tags: <a href="..."> with proper target/rel as needed
 Images: <img src="..." alt="..."> with descriptive alt text

**Forms basics**
 Form element: <form>
 Inputs: <input>, <select>, <textarea>, <button>, <label>
 Label associations: for attribute with id
 Name and id attributes on inputs
 Required attribute and basic GET/POST concepts

**Tables (brief refresher)**
 <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <td>, <th>
 Accessibility basics (scope, header rows)

**Accessibility and data hooks**
 Global attributes: id, class, data-*
 Landmarks: nav, main, footer for assistive tech
 ARIA basics as needed (roles, labels)

**HTML5 multimedia (optional for now)**
 <audio> and <video> basics
 <source> and <track> basics

**Data-driven hooks for htmx (conceptual)**
 Understand data-* attributes vs hx-* attributes
 Plan to use hx-* attributes in future (hx-post, hx-get, hx-target, hx-swap)

**Script and style integration**
 Linking CSS (external or internal)
 Linking JavaScript (external or internal)
 Inline vs external assets

**Practical exercises**
 Build: Expense form page (date, category, amount, description) with proper labels
 Build: Expense list with a totals header
 Create a fragment that would be swapped (an element with an id)
 Accessibility checks: ensure all controls have labels; images have alt text; landmarks present
 
**Integration prep for htmx**
 Identify swap targets in your UI
 Outline patterns you’ll reuse with htmx (e.g., a repeated card/list item structure)
 Plan a minimal hx-post-like form target (conceptual)
