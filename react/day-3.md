**Invoices** :

Your search functionality will span the client and the server. When a user searches for an invoice on the client, the URL params will be updated, data will be fetched on the server, and the table will re-render on the server with the new data.

**Why use URL search params?**
    As mentioned above, you'll be using URL search params to manage the search state. This pattern may be new if you're used to doing it with client side state.

    There are a couple of benefits of implementing search with URL params:

    Bookmarkable and shareable URLs: Since the search parameters are in the URL, users can bookmark the current state of the application, including their search queries and filters, for future reference or sharing.
    Server-side rendering: URL parameters can be directly consumed on the server to render the initial state, making it easier to handle server rendering.
    Analytics and tracking: Having search queries and filters directly in the URL makes it easier to track user behavior without requiring additional client-side logic.

**Adding the search functionality**
    These are the Next.js client hooks that you'll use to implement the search functionality:

    useSearchParams- Allows you to access the parameters of the current URL. For example, the search params for this URL /dashboard/invoices?page=1&query=pending would look like this: {page: '1', query: 'pending'}.
    usePathname - Lets you read the current URL's pathname. For example, for the route /dashboard/invoices, usePathname would return '/dashboard/invoices'.
    useRouter - Enables navigation between routes within client components programmatically. There are multiple methods you can use.

    You can use the url search params to show in above url and defaulte value for prefilling the above route value.
