Getting Started with NestJS: Learning Path for Our Team
As we begin to adopt NestJS in our development process, it's essential for everyone to be aligned and comfortable with the required foundational knowledge. This guide provides a structured path to help you get started effectively.

 Why NestJS?
NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. It leverages TypeScript and is heavily inspired by Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, making a strong understanding of OOP essential before learning NestJS.

Suggested Learning Roadmap
Please follow the steps in the given order for better understanding and smoother learning.

JavaScript: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Familiarize yourself with classes, inheritance, and encapsulation in JavaScript.

TypeScript Classes
Learn how TypeScript enhances JavaScript classes with features like type annotations and decorators.

[TypeScript Classes - Official Docs|https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html]

NestJS Documentation
Start by reading the Overview section in the official NestJS documentation. It provides a clear picture of how the framework works, its structure, and core principles.

[NestJS Documentation|https://docs.nestjs.com/]

Note: Please focus on the Overview section initially to grasp the architectural mindset behind NestJS.

Tips for Effective Learning
Make notes while reading.

Try small code examples to practice.

Feel free to ask questions in our team syncs or group chat.

Once you're confident, start a small NestJS sample project.

What’s Next?
After completing the above, we will have a team session to share insights, clarify concepts, and prepare for real project integration.

Let’s make this transition smooth and productive
