💡 Liability = What you owe to others

It’s the opposite of an Asset.

Assets = What you own
Liabilities = What you owe

Bank Loan	    You owe the bank money
Credit Card     Balance	You owe the card company
Rent Payable	You owe rent to your landlord
Salary Payable	You owe salary to employees

When you increase your liability → Credit
When you reduce your liability → Debit

Double- entry accounting tool : 

Double-entry accounting is a system of recording every financial transaction in at least two accounts, with one account debited and another credited. This method ensures a balanced and complete financial record because the total debits always equal the total credits, which is based on the fundamental accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. For example, when a business buys office equipment with cash, the office equipment account is debited and the cash account is credited, keeping the system balanced.  
How it works
Two sides to every transaction: Every financial event is recorded twice, impacting two different accounts. 
Debits and credits: Each transaction involves at least one debit and one credit entry. 
Debit: Increases an asset or an expense. 
Credit: Increases a liability, equity, or revenue. 
Maintains a balance: The sum of all debit entries must always equal the sum of all credit entries. This is the core principle of the system. 
Example: When a company takes out a $10,000 loan, the cash account (an asset) is debited by $10,000, and the loan payable account (a liability) is credited by $10,000, keeping the system balanced. 
Benefits
Accuracy and fraud prevention: The double-entry method provides a built-in check and balance system that helps ensure accuracy and makes it more difficult to commit fraud. 
Complete financial picture: It provides a comprehensive overview of a company's financial health, including all aspects of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. 
Enables financial statements: This system is the foundation for creating key financial statements like the balance sheet and income statement, which are essential for decision-making and reporting. 
Better decision-making: By providing accurate and complete data, it helps businesses make more informed financial decisions. 

**Accounts** :
    There are five types of Accounts:
        1) Assests - Things you own (e.g :- cash, investments, property).
        2) Liabilities - Mone you owe (e.g :- loans, credit cards).
        3) Income - Money you earn (e.g :- salary, interest).
        4) Expenses - Money you spend (e.g :- rent, groceries).
        5) Equity - Balancing account for rare cases (e.g :- opening balances).

    **Specific Account Types** : 
        Here what each type mean in detail:
            **Assets** : These are the things that you own and can include sub categories like Cash, Equity, Debt etc.
            Example : The recommended convention is to use Assets:{instrument_type}:{instrument_name}. The instrument type may be Cash, Equity, Debt, etc. The instrument name may be the name of the fund, stock, etc

            **Checking** : It is the account that we will money for daily use. It is not treated as like investment. If you want to create more accounts means you can use the sub type (Assets:Checking:HDFC or Assets:Checking:Axis)
            Example : **Assets:Checking** is where you keep money for daily use (not treated as an investment).

            **Income** : All your earnings go underd income: such as salary or interest.
            Example : Income:Salary:CompanyName or Income:Interest:FD

            **Expenses** : Money you spend is Categorized under Expenses : You can use Sub categries like Expenses:Tax:GST or Expenses:Food:Subway for better organization.

            **Liabilities** : Accounts you owe, such as credit cards, loans.
            Example : Liabilities:CreditCard:HDFC

            **Equity** : Used for balancing transaction when no other account fits.
            Example : Equity:OpeningBalance for opening balances.

    **EXAMPLES** : 
        Income Example 

        1) 2020/01/12 Salary
            Income:Salary:Acme    - 1000000 INR
            Assets:Checking       + 1000000 INR 

            Money earned from salary is credited to Income:Salary:Acme, and deposited into Assets:Checking.

        Expense Example 

        1) 2020/12/12
            Assets:Checking    -20 000 INR
            Expenses:Rent      +20 000 INR

            Rent paid is debited from Assets:Checking and credited to Expense:Rent.

    **Second Level Accounts** : 
        Add subcategories under the main types for better organization.
        Example : Assets:Debt , Income:Salary, Expense:food.

    **Third Level Accounts** : 
        Use more Accounts for more granularity.
        Example: Assets:Debt:EPF, Expenses:Food:Subway, Income:Interest:FD.

        Example of Hierarchy:
            Assets Hierarchy:
            Assets:
            Assets:Checking: Daily-use money (e.g., bank accounts).
            Assets:Checking:HDFC
            Assets:Checking:AXIS
            Assets:Debt: Investments or loans.
            Assets:Debt:EPF
            Assets:Debt:PPF
            Expenses Hierarchy:
            Expenses:
            Expenses:Food: Money spent on food.
            Expenses:Food:Subway
            Expenses:Food:McDonalds
            Expenses:Tax:
            Expenses:Tax:Income
            Expenses:Tax:GST
            How Hierarchy Helps in Queries
            With a hierarchical structure, you can ask questions like:

            What’s the total balance of Assets:Debt?
            This will include both EPF and PPF.
            What’s the total spent on Food?
            This will include both Subway and McDonalds.
